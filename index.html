                Explosion earthquakes are directly related to volcanic events, they occur with volcanic explosions: Strombolian or Vesuvian. Each explosion produces an earthquake; the seismic record is commonly accompanied by the acoustic signal.</font>

                        Strombolian eruptions are moderately explosive eruptions of basaltic magma with moderate gas content. Strombolian eruptions consist of intermittent, discrete explosive bursts which eject pyroclasts as high as hundreds of feet into the air in firework-like incandescent rooster-tails.

                        A type of volcanic activity marked by very explosive eruptions which occur after long periods of dormancy, during which gas pressures in the underlying magma have built up sufficiently to eject the plug of solid lava from the vent.
                        Plinian eruptions or Vesuvian eruptions are volcanic eruptions marked by their similarity to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which destroyed the ancient Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The eruption was described in a letter written by Pliny the Younger, after the death of his uncle Pliny the Elder.

                <p style="color:pink;"><b>Volcanic Earthquakes</b></p>
                Earthquakes directly beneath a volcano are caused by the movement of magma. The magma exerts pressure on the rocks until it cracks the rock. Then the magma squirts into the crack and starts building pressure again. Every time the rock cracks it makes a small earthquake. This is know as a Volcanic earthquake.

                The Ring of Fire is a string of volcanoes and sites of seismic activity, or earthquakes, around the edges of the Pacific Ocean. Roughly 90 percent of all earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire, and the ring is dotted with 75 percent of all active volcanoes on Earth. Is commonly where these earthquakes are found.
                <br>
                <br>
                According to Minakami (1959a, b, 1960) or Tazieff and Sabroux (1983), volcanic earthquakes are classified into three groups: A-type earthquakes with foci between 1 and 10 km deep; B-type earthquakes with foci at depths of 1 km or less; and explosion-type earthquakes taking place at the very surface of the Earth.

                <p style="color:pink;"><b>Collapse Earthquakes</b></p>
                A collapse earthquake are small earthquakes in underground caverns and mines that are caused by seismic waves produced from the explosion of rock on the surface. An explosion earthquake is an earthquake that is the result of the detonation of a nuclear and/or chemical device.
                <br>
                <br>
                Collapse earthquakes happen when a cave or mine collapses. These earthquakes are usually small, but they can be deadly if people are inside the collapsed structure.

                <p style="color:pink;"><b>Tectonic earthquake</b></p>
                The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel.
                <br>
                <br>
                These Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in Earth's crust where tectonic plates meet. They occur where plates are subducting, spreading, slipping, or colliding. As the plates grind together, they get stuck and pressure builds up.
                <br>
                <br>
                Tectonic earthquakes are explained by the so-called elastic rebound theory, formulated by the American geologist Harry Fielding Reid after the San Andreas Fault ruptured in 1906, generating the great San Francisco earthquake.

                    <p style="color: orange;"><b>Elastic Rebound Theory</b></p>
                    In geology, the elastic-rebound theory is an explanation for how energy is released during an earthquake.As the Earth's crust deforms, the rocks which span the opposing sides of a fault are subjected to shear stress. Slowly they deform, until their internal rigidity is exceeded. Then they separate with a rupture along the fault; the sudden movement releases accumulated energy, and the rocks snap back almost to their original shape. The previously solid mass is divided between the two slowly moving plates, the energy released through the surroundings in a seismic wave.

            <font size="75">
                <p style="color:pink;"><b>Energy of Earthquakes</b></p>
                earthquakes occur when elastic energy is accumulated slowly within the Earth's crust as a result of plate motions and then released suddenly at fractures in the crust called faults. The released energy travels in the form of waves called seismic waves.
                <br>
                <br>
                The time, location, and magnitude of an earthquake can be determined from the data recorded by seismometer. Seismometers record the vibrations from earthquakes that travel through the Earth. Each seismometer records the shaking of the ground directly beneath it.
                <br>
                <br>
                The method to find the Energy Magnitude and Moment Magnitude measure two different properties of the earthquake, their values are not the same. The energy release can also be roughly estimated by converting the moment magnitude, Mw, to energy using the equation log E = 5.24 + 1.44Mw, where Mw is the moment magnitude.

                <p style="color:pink;"><b>Types of Seismic Waves</b></p>
                The shifting rock in an earthquake causes vibrations called seismic waves that travel within Earth or along its surface. The four main types of seismic waves are P waves, S waves, Love waves, and Rayleigh waves.

                        <p style="color:orange;"><b>P waves</b></p>
                        A P wave (primary wave or pressure wave) is one of the two main types of elastic body waves, called seismic waves in seismology. P waves travel faster than other seismic waves and hence are the first signal from an earthquake to arrive at any affected location or at a seismograph.

                        <p style="color:orange;"><b>S waves</b></p>
                        S waves, also called shear or transverse waves, cause points of solid media to move back and forth perpendicular to the direction of propagation; as the wave passes, the medium is sheared first in one direction and then in another.

                        <p style="color:orange;"><b>Love Waves</b></p>
                        Love waves are a major type of surface wave having a horizontal motion that is shear or transverse to the direction of propagation. The velocity of propagation of any body wave in any homogeneous, isotropic material is determined by the elastic moduli and densities of the material through which it passes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One kind of surface wave is called a Love wave, named after British mathematician A. E. H. Love, who worked out the mathematical model for this wave type in 1911. Love waves produce entirely horizontal motion. The amplitude is largest at the surface and diminishes with greater depth.

                        <p style="color:orange;"><b>Rayleigh Waves</b></p>
                        A Rayleigh wave rolls along the ground with a more complex motion than Love waves. Although Rayleigh waves appear to roll like waves on an ocean, the particle motion is opposite of ocean waves. Because it rolls, it moves the ground up and down, and forward and backward in the direction that the wave is moving.
